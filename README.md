The Train Reservation System is a C++ console application designed to simulate a simplified train seat reservation system.
It supports functionalities such as reserving seats, managing a reservation list, canceling bookings, and displaying the train structure. 
This project is an excellent demonstration of using data structures like trees and queues in a practical context.

Key Features:
1) Train Setup: Configure cabins and seats in a hierarchical tree structure.
2) Seat Reservation: Allocate available seats or add passengers to a waitlist.
3) Reservation Management: Handle cancellations and reallocate seats from the waitlist.
4) Dynamic Displays: Show train structure, seat statuses, and reservation details.
5) Seat Summary: View counts of total, occupied, and available seats.

Data Structures:
1) Tree: Represents the train structure, supporting dynamic updates.
2) Queue: Manages the waitlist on a First-Come, First-Served basis.

Functional Flow:
1) Initialization: Set up cabins and seats as tree nodes.
2) Reservations: Check availability and allocate or queue requests.
3) Cancellations: Free seats and allocate them to queued passengers.
4) Display Options: View train structure and reservation statuses.

Menu Options:
1) Reserve seats.
2) View the reservation waitlist.
3) Cancel bookings.
4) Display the train structure.
5) Exit the program.

This project demonstrates efficient use of data structures in a practical application.
